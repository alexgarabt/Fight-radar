EDA subject practice to check the difference between some implentation of some data structures and algorithms.  
Each practice has a simple complexity study.  
Simple concept project of a background program of an app.  
Practice 1 is simple implementation with simple structures and algorithms.  
Practice 2 is with the use of QuadTree structure and comple algorithms.
