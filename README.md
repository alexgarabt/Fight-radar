**EDA subject practice** to check the difference between implentations of some data structures and algorithms.  
*Each practice has a simple complexity study.*

### Simple concept project of a background program of an app.  
1- [Practice 1][pdf1] is simple implementation with simple structures and algorithms.  
2- [Practice 2][pdf2] is a implementation with the use of QuadTree structure and complex algorithms.
